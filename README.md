## JS Project Proposal: Survival of the Typist

### Background

There is a video game called Typing of the Dead which is renown in the video game industry. The game is actually a modification of the arcade shooter House of the Dead, but this modification replaces guns with a keyboard and bullets with letters. In order to survive a zombie onslaught, players must type the right words and letters which will wade off the incoming enemies. However, type too slow or incorrectly and you'll get a game over.

### Functionality &amp; MVP  

With Survival of the Typist, users will be able to:

- [ ] Start, pause, and reset the game
- [ ] View the current word or letter needed to continue
- [ ] Input keyboard presses until the timer is up or the input matches the word

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] A By modal with links to my Github, LinkedIn and Personal Website
- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with game board, game controls, and nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn,
and the About modal.  Game controls will include Start, Stop, and Reset buttons as well as a slider to control the speed.  On the left, three clickable shapes will be used to toggle between the types of grids available.  On the right, there will be three (or more) clickable gradient-filled rectangles used to toggle between color schemes (see Bonus Features).  Additionally, a drop-down will be added to the Controls to toggle between different rule sets (again, see Bonus Features).

### Architecture and Technologies

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for game logic,
- `webpack.js` to bundle js files.


### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup all necessary Node modules, including getting webpack up and running and `Foo.js` installed. Write a basic entry file and the bare bones of all 3 scripts outlined above.  Learn the basics of `Foo.js`.  Goals for the day:

- Get a green bundle with `Webpack`
- Figure out what else is needed to make this project happen.

**Day 2**:

### Bonus features

If time permits, I will try to make this game prettier or add music of some sort.

- [ ] Make it pretty!
